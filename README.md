# Data Augmentation Using DCGAN & SRGAN to Provide Data Support for CNN Models
## Intrduction
This repository contains image generation code, deep learning classification code, and foundational datasets.
I have trained and tested the codes on
·CUDA 11.6
·Python 3.8
## Quick Start
### Under the DCGAN
· The default dataset is **‘data’**, you are advised to launch **train.py** to initiate the training process.
· Results will be automatically saved in the out folder.
### Under the Traditional Data Enhancement 
· The default dataset is data2. you are advised to launch **main.py** to initiate the training process.
### Under the Multiple models 
·The default dataset is data2.
Many thanks for dcgan_code and deep-learning-for-image-processing. A part of the code is borrowed from them.
